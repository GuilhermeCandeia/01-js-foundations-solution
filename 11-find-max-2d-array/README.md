# Find max in a two-dimensional array of numbers

## Context

This challenge tests your basic understanding of data types, conditionals, loops and functions.

## Requirements

Create a function named **`maxTwoDimArray`** that receives a two-dimensional array (also called matrix) of numbers as an argument.
The function should return the greatest number from the given nested arrays.

#### Sample Input/Output:

**Example 1:**

```
const twoDimArr1 = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 3, 8],
  [5, 12, 9]
]
```

**input**: `twoDimArr1`
**output**: 12

**Example 2**:

```
const twoDimArr2 = [
  [11, 23, 3],
  [4, 5, 34],
  [5, 3, 17]
]
```

**input**: `twoDimArr2`
**output**: 34

## Your code and submission

All your work should be done in the `Solution Code` section . To see how the function will be used check the tests provided in the `Sample Tests` section. (_Tests are very similar to the ones you have already seen in labs._)

<!-- All instructions are given in comments in the starter code inside `Your Solution` file. -->

**Hint**: You always want to reference the tests since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

### Submission

While taking the challenge, you can submit your progress multiple times on the `Submit Solution` button.

To do a final submission of the challenge, you have to go on the `Review Assessment` option in the upper right corner. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and do a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

Good luck!
