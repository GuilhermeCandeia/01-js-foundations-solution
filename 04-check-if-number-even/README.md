# Check if number is even

## Context

This challenge tests your basic understanding of data types, conditionals and functions.

## Requirements

Create a function named **`isEven`** that receives a number as an argument. The function should check the number and return `true` if number is even or `false` if it's not.

#### Sample Input/Output:

**input**: 4
**output**: `true`

**input**: 3
**output**: `false`

## Your code and submission

All your work should be done in the `Solution Code` section . To see how the function will be used check the tests provided in the `Sample Tests` section. (_Tests are very similar to the ones you have already seen in labs._)

<!-- All instructions are given in comments in the starter code inside `Your Solution` file. -->

**Hint**: You always want to reference the tests since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

### Submission

While taking the challenge, you can submit your progress multiple times on the `Submit Solution` button.

To do a final submission of the challenge, you have to go on the `Review Assessment` option in the upper right corner. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and do a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

Good luck!
