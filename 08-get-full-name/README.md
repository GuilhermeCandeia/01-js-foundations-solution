# Get the full name

## Context

This challenge tests your basic understanding of data types, conditionals and functions.

## Requirements

Create a function named **`getFullName`** that receives an object as an argument.
The function should return the concatenated string containing the `firstName` and `lastName` property values from the object.
More specifically, the returned string should represent a person's full name based on the provided object that contains the first and last name as its properties. Example object `{ firstName: 'Tony', lastName: 'Stark'}`.

#### Sample Input/Output:

**Example 1:**

```
const webStudent = {
  firstName: 'Ana',
  lastName: 'Alonso'
}
```

**input**: `webStudent`
**output**: `'Ana Alonso'`

**Example 2:**

```
const dataStudent = {
  firstName: 'mike',
  lastName: 'oliveira'
}
```

**input**: `dataStudent`
**output**: `'mike oliveira'`

## Your code and submission

All your work should be done in the `Solution Code` section . To see how the function will be used check the tests provided in the `Sample Tests` section. (_Tests are very similar to the ones you have already seen in labs._)

<!-- All instructions are given in comments in the starter code inside `Your Solution` file. -->

**Hint**: You always want to reference the tests since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

### Submission

While taking the challenge, you can submit your progress multiple times on the `Submit Solution` button.

To do a final submission of the challenge, you have to go on the `Review Assessment` option in the upper right corner. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and do a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

Good luck!
