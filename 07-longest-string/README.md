# Find the longest string

## Context

This challenge tests your basic understanding of data types, conditionals, loops and functions.

## Requirements

Create a function named **`longestString`** that receives an array of strings as an argument.
The function should return the longest string out of the array of provided strings.
If the array contains more than one string of the same length, the first found longest string should be returned.

#### Sample Input/Output:

**input**: `['ana', 'ivan', 'jan', 'nick']`
**output**: `'ivan'`

**input**: `['apple', 'pear', 'strawberries', 'mango']`
**output**: `'strawberries'`

**input**: `['foo', 'bar', 'baz']`
**output**: `'foo'`

## Your code and submission

All your work should be done in the `Solution Code` section . To see how the function will be used check the tests provided in the `Sample Tests` section. (_Tests are very similar to the ones you have already seen in labs._)

<!-- All instructions are given in comments in the starter code inside `Your Solution` file. -->

**Hint**: You always want to reference the tests since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

### Submission

While taking the challenge, you can submit your progress multiple times on the `Submit Solution` button.

To do a final submission of the challenge, you have to go on the `Review Assessment` option in the upper right corner. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and do a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

Good luck!
