# Does word exist

## Context

This challenge tests your basic understanding of data types, conditionals, loops and functions.

## Requirements

Create a function named **`doesWordExist`** that receives two arguments:

- an _array_ of strings and
- a _string_ with the word we want to check if it exists in that array.

The function should return`true`/`false` depending on if the word exists in the array or not.

#### Sample Input/Output:

**input**: `doesWordExist( ['ana', 'jan', 'nick'], 'jan' )`
output: `true`

**input**: `doesWordExist( ['apple', 'pear', 'strawberries', 'pineapple'], 'banana' )`
**output**: `false`

## Your code and submission

All your work should be done in the `Solution Code` section . To see how the function will be used check the tests provided in the `Sample Tests` section. (_Tests are very similar to the ones you have already seen in labs._)

<!-- All instructions are given in comments in the starter code inside `Your Solution` file. -->

**Hint**: You always want to reference the tests since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

### Submission

While taking the challenge, you can submit your progress multiple times on the `Submit Solution` button.

To do a final submission of the challenge, you have to go on the `Review Assessment` option in the upper right corner. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and do a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

Good luck!
